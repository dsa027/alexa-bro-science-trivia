# Summary

  A Bro Science Triva game written for Alexa

# Explanation

  This application uses Alexa and AWL Lambda to deliver a triva game on Bro Science. Five questions will be asked and several answers will be given to choose the correct answer from.

# Problem

  This is of moderate complexity and uses several Amazon technologies. The application was written using Amazon's trivia template.

# Solution

  The solution was easier on this second Alexa skills project since I'd gone through learning the jargon and how to create these skills. The application is complete, with Intents, Slots, Endpoint, and an AWS Lambda.

# Results

  The skill could use more questions.

# Conclusion
